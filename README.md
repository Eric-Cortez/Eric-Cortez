## Hi, I'm Eric 👋 

I am a passionate software engineer and I enjoy developing resopnsive 
websites that incorperate elements of modern design using technologies 
like HTML, CSS3, Grids, and JavaScript. . Additionally, I enjoy testing 
backend routes, problem-solving, and using console logs and reading 
errors to find the source of a bug.

I love the process of developing my ideas into existence and finding ways 
to research and implement new technologies to improve user experience.
